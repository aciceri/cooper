abstract="Lower bounds are established on the computational complexity of the decision problem and on the inherent lengths of proofs for two classical decidable theories of logic: the first-order theory of the real numbers under addition, and Presburger arithmetic --- the first-order theory of addition on the natural numbers. There is a fixed constant c > 0 such that for every (nondeterministic) decision procedure for determining the truth of sentences of real addition and for all sufficiently large n, there is a sentence of length n for which the decision procedure runs for more than 2cnsteps. In the case of Presburger arithmetic, the corresponding bound is {\$}{\$}{\{}2^{\{}{\{}2^{\{}cn{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}. These bounds apply also to the minimal lengths of proofs for any complete axiomatization in which the axioms are easily recognized.",
